The final report is uploaded as a PDF File, this README.md is a summarized version of that.

## The Project

### 0 - Overview
For this project, our team was tasked with creating a robot that was able to traverse a pre-defined obstacle course, and this report articulates all such efforts and measures undertaken in the design and engineering process, including lessons that we had learnt during the process of developing this robot. This report encapsulates the whole process of development and elaborates on all the various areas of engineering considerations that were involved, inclusive of but not limited to â€“ Electrical, Mechanical, Software, and Design. In this report, we shall attempt to document our process, from the template project at the very beginning, to the final run of the robot.

### 1 - Prototyping and Progress
We had utilized multiple design prototypes for each component and a variation of combinations of each component was used in the making of a general rough prototype. Thus, the assembly of each prototype of the robot had many sub-prototypes pertaining to variations in these individual components. Generally, there were 4 main stages to the making of the robot. Stage 0 was the simple assembly of the template project given to us. Stage 1 was the design of the main vehicular body of the robot, and Stage 2 was the incorporation of the ball-deployment mechanism into the main body of the robot. Stage 3 was the finalization and optimization of the robot to prepare for the graded run and submission.

### 7 - Conclusion
The lessons we had learned along the way were of a multifaceted nature. On top of the directly affecting aspects of making the robot, such as Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Designing, we had also learned other crucial things like the importance of work delegation, the efficiency of simultaneous and concurrent development of prototypes to fully utilize all available manpower, the importance of accuracy and precision in design, and most importantly, the virtue of accepting, understanding, and learning from our mistakes with a positive mindset and approach such that we are able to improve on them on our path to eventual success. 

## Prototypes

### Prototype 1

This prototype was to test the structural rigidity of the laser-cut wheels and wheel traction.
